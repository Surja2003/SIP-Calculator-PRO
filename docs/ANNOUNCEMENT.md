# Launch: SIP Calculator PRO

I just launched my personal finance toolkit — SIP, Lumpsum, SWP, and Goal Calculators — all standardized to monthly compounding with clean visualizations and dark mode.

- Live site: https://surja2003.github.io/SIP-Calculator-PRO/
- Tech: React + Vite, Tailwind/MUI, MongoDB + Express (backend)

Highlights:
- Monthly-compounded math across all calculators
- SIP step-up and inflation-adjusted projections
- SWP breakdowns (withdraw-then-grow) and scenarios
- Mobile-friendly UI and SPA routing

Feedback and contributions are welcome!
